Jet Racer - 3D Racing Game
==========================

Back when I am working on my master degree in 2003, I am fascinated with computer graphics. Lots of interesting techniques, such as image texturing, shadow rendering, particle systems, etc. So here is my attempt to make a simple 3D game.

Jet Racer is a 3D game in which player has to control a vehicle through a number of poles.

Keys :

```
1 - 1 player only
2 - You  play against the computer
c - change camera view
ESC - quit
m - turn  map on or off
r - restart
b - begin
i - accelerate
k - decelerate
j  - turn left
l - turn right

```

The game is written in OpenGL. To play, unzip it to a directory and execute jetracer.exe to
play. It requires GLUT to be installed first.
