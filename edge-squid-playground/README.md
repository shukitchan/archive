Setting up Squid on EC2
=======================

To do that with cloud-init on AWS, I create a new instance. I pick the Basic 64-bit Amazon Linux AMI and use Micro Instance
(the free-tier!). And then I use the following as my User Data.

```
#!/bin/bash -ex
yum -y install httpd
yum -y install php
yum -y install squid
yum -y install git-core
cd /etc/
mkdir /etc/squid-playground
cd /etc/squid-playground
git clone git://github.com/shukitchan/edge-squid-playground.git
mv /etc/squid/squid.conf /etc/squid/squid.conf.old
cp /etc/squid-playground/edge-squid-playground/squid.conf /etc/squid/squid.conf
ln -s /etc/squid-playground/edge-squid-playground/test0.php /var/www/html/test0.php
ln -s /etc/squid-playground/edge-squid-playground/test1.php /var/www/html/test1.php
/usr/sbin/apachectl -k start
/usr/sbin/squid -z
/etc/init.d/squid start
```

And thatâ€™s it. This will setup an apache server on port 80 and Squid on port 8080 with the local apache as origin
server. You can see the execution of the script in /var/log/cloud-init

There are two test php scripts included. The output for one is cacheable while the other is not. Try them out.

```
curl -v 'http://localhost:8080/test0.php'
curl -v 'http://localhost:8080/test1.php'
```
